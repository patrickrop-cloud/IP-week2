This Web application is basically to showcase indivitual understanding of the  for week 2 content. Git has been used greatly to track changes that have been made to files and a commit is regularly done to ensure the page is presentable and appealing. The commits are made and pushed regularly to master and the requests are pulled and merges done on the files. And finally, the project is deployed to github pages.
